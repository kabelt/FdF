# FdF :milky_way:
A C program with an ability to transform topography data coming in the form of an [ARC/INFO ASCII GRID] file(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid) whose headers are removed to be a 3D graphic representation.\
All of the features were implemented from scratch without any help from external libraries. :star:

including some cool hidden features, try it yourself!
### Requirements
This project relies on MiniLibX and can be run only on MacOS.
### Installations
Run the following command in your terminal. You should see the window similar to the above screenshot.
```shell
cd ~/Downloads && git clone https://github.com/kabelt/FdF.git FdF && cd FdF && make && ./FdF maps/Thailand.fdf
```
### Want FDF to display you own map?
You can find the details about how .fdf files works [here](https://github.com/kabelt/FdF/files/5094400/fdf.en.pdf) on page 9-10.\
Then relaunch FdF with your map;
```shell
./FdF <your_map>
```
### Acknowledgements
The illustration shown above is a representation of Thailand geography.\
The input raw map was generated by [42MapGenerator](https://github.com/jgigault/42MapGenerator) using the information from [The Marine Geoscience Data System (MGDS)](http://www.marine-geo.org/index.php).\
This project is part of 42 pedagogy.
